Welcome to your InvenioRDM instance.

## Getting started

Run the following commands in order to start your new InvenioRDM instance:

```console
invenio-cli containers start --lock --build --setup
```

The above command first builds the application docker image and afterwards
starts the application and related services (database, Opensearch, Redis
and RabbitMQ). The build and boot process will take some time to complete,
especially the first time as docker images have to be downloaded during the
process.

Once running, visit https://127.0.0.1 in your browser.

**Note**: The server is using a self-signed SSL certificate, so your browser
will issue a warning that you will have to by-pass.
