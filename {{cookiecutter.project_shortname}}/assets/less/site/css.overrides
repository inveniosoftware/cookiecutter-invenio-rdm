/*
   A last resort point for defining your own css.
   If you want to style ui elements, the preferable location is
   elements/<component>.variables to use invenio CSS with just some
   variables redefined or elements/<component>.overrides to completely
   override CSS

   To see which variables can be overridden, look at for example
   https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-theme/blob/master/invenio_theme/assets/semantic-ui/less/invenio_theme/theme/elements/button.variables

   To see how to write .overrides, look at
   https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-theme/blob/master/invenio_theme/assets/semantic-ui/less/invenio_theme/theme/elements/button.overrides
